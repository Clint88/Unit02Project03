        <h2>Rule an Ancient City</h2>

        <p>Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer 
        Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. 
        Players adopt role cards of characters from ancient 
        Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage 
        the administration of a city. Each role provides 
        a different ability and strategy. However, 
        one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players 
        must be constantly aware of betrayal 
        and double-cross. This card game provides a ton 
        of enjoyment and can handle up to eight players 
        and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>
        
        <p>This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must 
        carefully choose his or her roles and 
        the strategies can quickly change with the turn 
        of a card. However the level of randomness is 
        just right and cunning and resourcefulness can 
        overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not 
        recommend this game unless there are at least 4 
        players; less than that reduces the intrigue 
        and some of the game appeal.</p>

        <h2>Highly Recommended</h2>
        
        <p>Towers and Temples is a great game. The balance is 
        just about perfect and each player must 
        carefully choose roles each turn. Even though the 
        strategic possibilities are nearly endless, 
        the game is simple to learn. The replay value is 
        high and gets even better when you replace 
        some of the cards with new cards available in the 
        expansion packs.</p>

        <h2>Great Strategic Board Game</h2>
        
        <p>We tested Towers and Temples with everything from 2 
        to 6 players and we can strongly 
        recommend the game. The different phases of the 
        game are interesting and intriguing, from
        bluffing and stealing to site construction and planning. 
        With the variety of cards and 
        scenarios, no two games are ever quite the same. It's 
        a great introduction to the world of 
        strategic board games and role playing.</p>

        <h2>An Incredible Game</h2>
        
        <p>The artwork on the cards and the board is excellent 
        and one of the best around. As 
        for play, this game offers lots of strategy, and there 
        are tough decisions to make every 
        turn. It's not only important to select the character 
        that increases your chances for scoring, 
        but also to anticipate the characters the opponents 
        are likely to select, and then hedge against 
        their availability. This causes a lot of unpredictability 
        and deep strategic thinking. However, 
        it can still be played at a more basic level for 
        younger users.</p>
        
        <p>We had a lot of fun with this game and rate it as 
        Best in its Class. Highly recommended.</p>

        <h2>Decide the Fate of the World</h2>
        
        <p>Alliance challenges you and your opponents to decide 
        the outcome. As one of the world powers 
        battling for supremacy you must lead your country's
        military drive; but you can't do it alone. 
        You have to form alliances and then betray your 
        allies before they betray you!</p>
        
        <p>Decide where to strike, when to strike, and the intensity
        of the strike. Will it be a bombing 
        raid, an offshore missile barrage, or an invasion 
        with land forces and tanks? Plan your attack, 
        move into enemy territory with your forces and win 
        the conflict.</p>
        
        <p>The economic destiny of your nation is also at stake. 
        Buy armaments and develop secret 
        weapons from your country's economic funds and 
        natural reserves, but be sure to save 
        something for the future.</p>

        <h2>Tedious and Confusing</h2>
        
        <p>The list of war simulation games is long. All of them 
        share similar features including the 
        formation of temporary Alliance and battles simulated 
        through random draws of a deck or the 
        roll of the die. Alliance offers very little that 
        is new or innovative in that regard.</p>
        
        <p>We found the game to be too drawn-out and confusing. 
        In fact, I dare say we spent more time 
        reading and rereading the rule book than actually 
        playing the game. If you want to read a 
        book on war, we suggest Sun Tzu.</p>

        <h2>Decent Game but Many are Better</h2>
        
        <p>Alliance is a good war simulation game. We found the 
        game play to be robust and engaging. The 
        rules are long and drawn out but, for anyone with 
        experience in this class of board games, there 
        is little there that's unexpected or difficult. We 
        think the battle simulation cards are some of 
        the best we have encountered.</p>
        
        <p>All of that being said, the competition for this type 
        of game is fierce. There are a lot of 
        established titles with loyal clients. We're not 
        exactly sure where Alliance fits in with 
        that group. It's a good game, but not good enough 
        to draw our attention away from games like 
        Battle Tested and Global Conflict.</p>

        <h2>Fun and Challenging</h2>
        
        <p>Alliance is fun game and is sure to appeal to 
        war game enthusiasts. We think it offers several new 
        ideas that we're surprised have not been utilized in other simulation games. The card system and the 
        investment options give the game a "real world" feel.</p>
        
        <p>Things We Liked</p>

            <li>Variety of Battle Scenarios</li>
            <li>Flexible Rules and Setup</li>
            <li>Detail and Historical Accuracy</li>
            <li>Wealth of Expansion Packs</li>

        </ul>
            
        <p>Things We Hated</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
            <li>Long and Complicated Rule Book</li>
            <li>Setup takes too Long</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This is a great game for anyone 16 years or older. Younger players may have trouble with the rules and may be bored</p>
